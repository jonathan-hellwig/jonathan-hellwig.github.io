As an industrial mathematics graduate with a deep interest in robotics and machine learning, I am eager to work and innovate on real-world systems. For the past two years, I have been a member of the RoboCup SPL team [HULKs e.V.](https://hulks.de/) focusing my efforts on localization, sensor fusion and object detection working on obtaining a more accurate representation of the game state. During my time at the HULKs I have participated in multiple international tournaments and worked in a team made up of mostly Computer Science students. This allowed me to learn to collaborate in an interdisciplinary team and take advantage of my mathematical background.

Devising new ideas and working on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms excites me to no end. Therefore, I have decided to fully dive into research and am currently looking for open PhD positions. You can reach me at jonathan[dot]hellwig[at]protonmail[dot]com.
