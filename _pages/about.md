The process of generating new ideas and working on state-of-the-art **machine learning** algorithms fills me with excitement, which has motivated me to pursue a research-oriented career. As a result, I am currently **looking for Ph.D. positions** and **internship opportunities**. You can reach me at jonathan[dot]hellwig[at]protonmail[dot]com.

As an industrial mathematics graduate with a deep interest in robotics and machine learning, I am eager to work and innovate on real-world systems. Over the last two years, my focus as a member of the RoboCup SPL team [HULKs e.V.](https://hulks.de/) has been on localization, sensor fusion, and object detection. My goal has been to improve the accuracy of the game state representation. During my time at the HULKs I have participated in multiple international tournaments and worked in a team made up of mostly Computer Science students. This allowed me to learn to collaborate in an interdisciplinary team and take advantage of my mathematical background.
