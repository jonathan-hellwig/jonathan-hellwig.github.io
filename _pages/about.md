<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi, I am an industrial mathematics graduate of the University of Hamburg. My main topics of interest are robotics, machine learning, numerical simulations and applying mathematics to real-world systems. For the past two years, I have been a member of the RoboCup SPL team [HULKs e.V.](https://hulks.de/) focusing my efforts on localization, sensor fusion and object detection.

I am currently looking for a PhD position. You can reach me at jonathan[dot]hellwig[at]protonmail[dot]com.
